\title{smoother borders}
\usage{
smooth_borders(x, r)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a real matrix}

\item{r}{a positive integer}
}
\value{
a matrix of the same dimensions as x
}
\description{
let a field decrease linearly towards its edges
}
\details{
Values within the field are linearly reduced from their original value to the field minimum, starting r pixels away from the edge. This enforces truely periodic boundaries. It may be a good idea to apply this to you input data before doing the wavelet analysis. Consider removing the altered border afterwards ...
}
\note{
r must not be larger than \code{min( dim(x) )/2}.
