\title{filterbanks for the dtcwt}

dtcwt python package (\url{https://github.com/rjw57/dtcwt})

\description{
Some of the filters implemented in the python package dtcwt.
}
\details{
The near-sym filterbanks are biorthogonal wavelets used for the first level, they have 13 and 19 taps. The qshift filterbanks, each with 14 taps, are suitable for all higher levels of the dtcwt. The a- and b-filters form an approximate Hilbert-pair. The naming convention follows the python-package: \tabular{ll}{ h: \tab analysis\cr g:\tab synthesis\cr 0:\tab low-pass\cr 1:\tab high-pass\cr a,b: \tab shifted filters}
The \code{b_bp}-versions of the filterbanks contain a second high-pass for the diagonal directions, denoted by 2. They allow for better directional selectivity but prohibit perfect reconstruction.
