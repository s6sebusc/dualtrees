Description: An implementation of the decimated two-dimensional complex dual-tree wavelet transform as described in Kingsbury (1999): 'Image processing with complex wavelets' and Selesnick et al. (2005): 'The Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform'. Also includes the undecimated version and spectral bias correction described in Nelson et al (2018): 'The locally stationary dual-tree complex wavelet model'. The code is partly based on the dtcwt Python library.
