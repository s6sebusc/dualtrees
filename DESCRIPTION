Description: An implementation of the decimated two-dimensional complex dual-tree wavelet transform as described in Kingsbury (1999): ''Image processing with complex wavelets'' and Selesnick et al. (2005): ''The Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform''. Also includes the undecimated version and spectral bias correction described in Nelson et al (2018): ''The locally stationary dual-tree complex wavelet model''. The code is partly based on the dtcwt Python library.
